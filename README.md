# Timeouts-Intervals
Exercice JS


Creating games using javascript.
- function Interval and TimeOut

I used a pre-made css code to style the title

Here is the link https://sophiegillard.github.io/Timeouts-Intervals/

How does the game work:
- click on the white circles. 
- if you click on the white circle you get 100
- if you click on an empty circle you lose one life
- if you have no lives left, you are GAME OVER and the page reload to start again
